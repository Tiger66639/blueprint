{"name":"Blueprint","tagline":"","body":"Blueprint Build System\r\n======================\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tiger66639/blueprint.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Tiger66639/blueprint)\r\n\r\nBlueprint is a meta-build system that reads in Blueprints files that describe\r\nmodules that need to be built, and produces a\r\n[Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) manifest describing the commands that\r\nneed to be run and their dependencies.  Where most build systems use built-in\r\nrules or a domain-specific language to describe the logic for converting module\r\ndescriptions to build rules, Blueprint delegates this to per-project build\r\nlogic written in Go.  For large, heterogenous projects this allows the inherent\r\ncomplexity of the build logic to be maintained in a high-level language, while\r\nstill allowing simple changes to individual modules by modifying easy to\r\nunderstand Blueprints files.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
